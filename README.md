# Angular-Training

`APM-Start`: The starter files set up for use in VSCode, WebStorm, or other editors. **(Updated for <i>Angular version 10 or higher</i>)**

`APM-Final`: The completed files. Use this to see the completed solution. (Updated for <i>Angular version 10 or higher</i>)

See the `README.md` file under each folder for details on installing and running the application.

NOTE: The installation was tested using node v12.16.1 and npm 6.13.4.

## INSTALLING THE CODE

The following are detailed instructions for installing the code

0) Ensure you have node installed.

   At a command prompt, type `node -v` to ensure you have version `10.16.0` or higher before proceeding.

1) Download or clone the code from this repository.

   If you download as a zip file, be sure to unzip it.

2) Navigate to the APM-Start folder (or APM folder if you renamed it).

   There should be a package.json file in this folder.

3) In a command window (or the Command prompt in VS Code), type `npm install`.

   This creates a node_modules folder and installs all packages from the package.json file into that folder. You may see a few warnings during this process, but you should not see any errors.
   
4) In the same command window (or the Command property in VS Code), type `npm start`.

   The application should then compile and launch in your default browser.
